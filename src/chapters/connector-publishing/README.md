How Microsoft Manages these Connectors

- Currently there are almost 200+ premium connectors available in the Microsoft gallery. To increase this the Power Platform Community encourages users to publish connectors via the Independent Publisher Program. 

To get your connector certified, either we need to upload the connector definition (swagger file) to the PowerPlatformConnector Repository. If you have any reason not to open source the connector code, then based on the approval, you can submit it to the ISV Studio.


Currently Microsoft uses Open Source Collaborative Method to manage some of the public connectors via GitHub Repository

If you want to create one, you can fork the repository and send a pull request for that connector
